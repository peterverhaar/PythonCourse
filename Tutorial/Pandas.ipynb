The name of the library loosely stands for “Python Data Analysis Library”. Pandas contains methods that enable programmers to read data from and write data to a wide range of file formats, including CSV, TSV, Excel spreadsheets and MySQL databases, and it offers numerous statistical methods that can be used to analyse these data.\n",
